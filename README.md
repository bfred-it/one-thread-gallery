RES makes it easy to show all images in comments, but I hate it that I cannot share all the images at once.

This micro web app will let you share a URL most of the images in the comments.

Shareable URL example: https://redditpost.ga/?url=669c9k

Try with: https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/669c9k/psbattle_this_cat_longing_for_attention/

PRs welcome!
